# ML---Fertilizer-Prediction
based on the soil elements and other attributes the model predicte the appropriate agricultural fertilizer to make the soil suitable for this crop
## Atrributes:
- Temperature 
- Humidity
- Rainfall
- Soil - type of soil(0 "Clayey" , 1 "laterite", 2 "silty clay", 3 "sandy",4 "coastal",5 "clay loam",6 "alluvial")
- Crop - Name of crop (0 "rice",1 "Coconut")
- N - ratio of Nitrogen (NH4+) content in soil 
- P - ratio of Phosphorous (P) content in soil 
- K - ratio of Potassium (K) content in soil 
- ph - soil acidity (pH)
## Target
- Fertilizer: categorical (0 "DAP and MOP: Source of P and K",
1"Good NPK: NPK are sufficient in soil. No need to apply any fertilizer", 2 "MOP: Source of K",
3 "Urea and DAP: Source of N and P",4 "Urea and MOP: Source of N and K",5 "Urea: Source of N only",
6 "DAP: Source of P only DAP= Diammonium phosphate, MOP= Muriate of Potash")
